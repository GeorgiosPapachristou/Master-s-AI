### About Me

I am an experienced Senior Internal Control and Compliance Officer at an International Organization with more than 12 years of working experience. I hold a PhD in Accounting and I am currenlty studying Artificial Intelligence at Master's level at the University of Essex Online.


### Artefacts

*   Units 1-3

    During these units, a discussion over the 4th Industrial Revolution was conducted. Apart from the benefits of this revolution, an incident where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact was analysed. In the link below, the discussion on "The Global PlayStation Network Crash" can be seen.

*   Unit 2
  
    Exploratory Data Analysis

    EDA is valuable to data science projects as it allows to get closer to the certainty that the future results will be valid, correctly interpretes, and applicab;e to the desired business contexts. EDA is performed to define the refine the selection of feature variables that will be used for machine learning. In the link below, a practicing example of EDA can be seen.

*   Unit 3
  
    Correlation and Regression

    Correlation and regression are statistical techniques to quantify and describe the relationship between variables. Correlation quantifies the strength and type of relationship whereas regression express the relationship in the form of equation that enable us to predict value and relationship of unseen variables. In the link below, a practicing example of regression analysis can be seen.

*   Unit 4
  
    Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

    In this unit, the application of the fundamentals of linear regression in Scikit-Learn was learnt, as well as how to model linear relationships between a single independent and dependent variable, and multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable. In the link below, a practicing example of regression analysis can be seen.

*   Unit 5
  
    Clustering

    Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and being used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. In the link below, a practicing example of cluster analysis can be seen.

*   Unit 6
  
    Clustering with Python

    In this unit, the application of clustering (K-means) on data using the Python libraries in scikit-learn was performed. In addition, at the end of this unit, a team project, analysing Airbnb was submitted. In the links below, practicing example of cluster analysis (Iris case) as well as the team project on Airbnb can be seen.

*   Unit 7

    Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

    Artificial neural network (ANN) is a biology inspired algorithm that, like animal brain, can learn from the environment and adapt itself to make more correct decisions. ANN is a key driver for the industry 4.0 revolution, where machines are making decisions with minimal or no human interactions. In the links below, practicing examples of ANNs can be seen.

    Training an Artificial Neural Network

    Training is one the foundaments steps when it comes to the development of an ANN. In the links below, practicing examples of training ANNs can be seen.

    Introduction to Convolutioanl Neural Networks (CNNs)

    Convolutional neural network is an extension of artificial neural network that forms the basis of computer vision; the way computers see and understand the physical world. In the links below, personal reflections on the ethical and social implications of CNN technology are presented.

*   Units 8-10

*   During these units, a discussion over the the risks and benefits of the use AI writers at different levels, from administrative work to creative writing was conducted. In the link below, evidence of the discussion can be seen.

    Model Selection and Evaluation

    Model selection and evaluation, are important procedures in the machine learning workflow. Selection of correct model(s) is like selecting the correct tool(s) to do a specific job, which in machine learning case is prediction or classification. Once selected, the model(s) should be evaluated based on their performance. In the links below, evidence of the assignment on "Neural Network Models for Object Recognition" can be seen.
